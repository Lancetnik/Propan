# HELP

Do you like **Propan**?

Maybe you want to help the project, other users or the author?

There are several ways you can do it.

## Support

Now the project is actively developing on the bare enthusiast of its author. If you want to help, but are not ready to spend time writing code/documentation, you can just give your feedback. This is the fuel that fires :fire: enthusiasm.

### Star on GitHub

You can show your interest by putting a "star" **Propan** on GitHub(clicking the star button at the top right):

<a href="https://github.com/Lancetnik/Propan/" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/Lancetnik/Propan/</a>:star:

The more stars there are, the easier for other users to find the project and that it has been already useful for others.

### Watch changes on GitHub

You can "watch" Propan on GitHub  (clicking the "watch" button at the top right):

<a href="https://github.com/Lancetnik/Propan/" class="external-link" target="_blank">https://github.com/Lancetnik/Propan/</a>:eyes:

There you can also specify in the settings - "Release only". This way you will receive notifications only about important changes in the repository.
