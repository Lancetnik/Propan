# TODO

The project is currently under active development and I really need your help to bring it to release as soon as possible!

## Documentation

At the moment, the main activity for the development of the project is the preparation of documentation.

You will be very helpful if

* Correct errors, typos, inaccuracies

* Add translations of individual pages or sections

To participate in the development of documentation, go to the following [section](../3_docs/)

## Code

To start developing the project, go to the following [section](../2_contributing-index/).

If you want to develop your own adapter for any broker, you will find a lot of useful information in [this](../4_adapters/) section.
